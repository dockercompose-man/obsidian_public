# Michael's "Boilerplates"

Hi, there! 👋

I’m Michael, a 37-year-old tech enthusiast from Canada, and I love to inspire and educate people in IT.

This Repository **Boilerplates** is my personal template collection. Here you'll find templates, and configurations for various tools, and technologies.

> ⚠️ Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this won’t always be the case.

I created them as free resources to be used in your specific use cases. If you're searching for detailed, in-depth tutorials on some tools or technologies, check out my Website: [Orangefarm](https://discord.gg/nUFabsxxrW)

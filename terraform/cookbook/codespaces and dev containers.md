# 3.1 Codespaces and Dev Containers

You need to be able to code while mobile and away from your standard office setting.

Working on problems in the comfortable space of your office can make your infrastructure as code sessions quite lovely. Maybe you have a favorite artist you listen to while you work or a chillwave playlist from Spotify. When you need to leave the comfort of your office, you can be left in the lurch with your coding environment when you’re moving or traveling. Not everyone can bring their desktop machine or coding workstation with them, and this recipe is for anyone on the go or who favors moving their workspace entirely into the cloud.

## Solution

Getting this recipe working contains quite a few steps, so buckle up and prepare for all these moving parts. Wel’ll be using [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSC), and a browser to complete these steps, so be sure to sign up and download those as you need.

To begin, create a .devcontainer folder at the root of your directory, then an empty Dockerfile and devcontainer.json file (Figure 3-1).
